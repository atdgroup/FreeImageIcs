
Windows viewer example code
===========================

This directory contains the sources for a very simple viewer
utility. You'll need Visual C++ and Windows to run this.

Basically, it's an example on how to use libics to read in
a 2D preview of an ICS file. The file readics.c is the basis
of the ICS plug-in for IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.com).

The code in this directory falls under the same licence
terms as libics itself.
